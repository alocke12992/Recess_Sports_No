Trisha Paytas shares a very emotional YouTube upload on her channel with over 1 million subscribers to let her fans know why she and long time boyfriend Jason Nash broke up. Nash, also a YouTuber with 1 million subscribers, seemed to have hit a very sensitive spot for Trisha and now there’s no going back.



Paytas and Nash were set to go on a live tour this summer called “Trisha & Jason Are In Love,” the YouTube star mentions that refunds will be provided as not only is her relationship with Jason over but she will be taking some time off from YouTube and other socials. Paytas rose to fame as one of YouTube’s first digital stars with a huge personality and a lot of talent. This video is truly heartbreaking as Trisha struggles to explain through tears that she has let Jason go over a fat comment he made about her during an interview.



I have NEVER lied or fabricated ANYTHING. the word “fat” was the trigger. he never apologized that night when I brought it up, the next day, and the morning after. NEVER apologized

She explains that her weight has been her lifelong struggle and although she deals with “fat jokes” often in her comments, no one whom she loves has ever called her fat to her face and not taking it back. The problem arose when Jason was comfortable enough to say “well we’re both fat,” after Trish expressed discomfort and sadness over the comment, Jason was unapologetic and told her she shouldn’t take things so hard. He also went on to say that she is the first one to talk “crap” about others so why was this such a big deal.



Paytas is emotional throughout the entire video still defending Jason and saying he has a “huge heart” and that the break up was over her insecurities. It is tough to watch her announce that she will be taking a month hiatus from all social media including the companies she sponsors. She reassures her viewers that she loves YouTube as this is her job but that during this time the amount of pain she feels is just too much to work or be around others.



She ends the video by expressing her love for her viewers, saying she’ll be okay and that she will be spending time alone and working out. Trisha you are so beautiful, that’s a sentiment we all share about you. Watch the video below and show Trisha and others who suffer from insecurities like this some love today!
